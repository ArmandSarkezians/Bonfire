# Sprint Retrospective 1

As you complete the previous sprint, you must have SRn.md (n is your previous sprint number) in doc/sprint(n+1).
Once the sprint retrospective finishes, you must hold the next sprint planning meeting and record it in sprintn.md where of course n is the new sprint number.

Example:
After finishing sprint 1, Team Collabcloud creates a SR1.md in doc/sprint2 and sprint2.md in doc/sprint2.
