Our team is composed of a group of 3rd year students that have known each other for quite some time. In order to organize ourselves for this assignment however, we formed a new discord server with well defined channels and categories where we actively perform relative discussions

PDF Documents that needed to be worked are shared in a private team drive folder and are pinned in the general chat for quick and easy access through discord. Any decisions are made in their respective file by jotting down all the respective ideas and expanding on each one while voting for the best. The priorities of tasks were set in a similar manner.
### Meeting plan

During the start of the sprint, we met everyday, but as the sprint progressed and the group became more aligned in our goals and product we stopped meeting as often.
Going forward, we should spend more time going through the sprint requirements individually and be prepared to take on some tasks or argue some points in the initial meeting.

As a team, we agreed to perform regular stand-up meetings to synchronize the group on where we are at in the sprint. One or two standup meetings a week was agreed on by all group members: one at the begging of the week and one at the end of the week. Every standup, every group member will discuss what they have completed since the previous standup, their plan for the next 3-4 days, and if they have any blockers. If some time is left, any ideas or features to add to the backlog could be discussed. Before every sprint ends, the team will get into a call to discuss anything needed to improved on, in terms of efficiency or responsiveness, and a short practice demo for the demo to be performed in the tutorial.

### Division of Work

Everyone will have a say on their division of work but everyone has to come to an agreement about it for their own designated division of work to be recognized. Also, depending on the circumstances team members might want to re-adjust their division of work and will be able to do so long everyone else gives their consent.

### Focus for Sprint 1

### Story points and estimation

| Story points | How much work effort required | Dependencies|
|-----------|--------|------------
| 1 | <2 hours | None
| 2 | 1/2 day | Almost None
| 3 | <2 days | Couple
| 5 | <4 days |  More than a few
| 8 | <7 days |  A lot
| 13 | More than a week | Unknown

###### On average, it took 1 or 2 rounds of voting to come to consensus for the point estimation using planning poker. This may have been as a result of the chemistry of the group members. As a team, we agreed that scoring a story as 8 or 13 should be very rare and means the story should be broken down and worked on more than a single developer
