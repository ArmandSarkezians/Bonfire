Our team is composed of a group of students that have know eachother for quite some time, so we already knew eachother quite well. In order to organize ourselves for this assignment however, we formed a new discord server with well defined channels and categories.
Documents that needed to be worked on live were shared in a team drive folder for quick and easy access. Then any decisions were made in their respective file by jotting down all the respective ideas and expanding on each one while voting for the best. The priorities of tasks were set in a similar manor.



● How did you make decisions?

● How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?


● How frequently did you meet?
We met as a complete group on average every other day and smaller groups met whenever necessary.

● What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
