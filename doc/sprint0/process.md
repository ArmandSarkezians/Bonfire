Our team is composed of a group of students that have know eachother for quite some time, so we already knew eachother quite well. In order to organize ourselves for this assignment however, we formed a new discord server with well defined channels and categories.

Documents that needed to be worked on live were shared in a team drive folder for quick and easy access. Then any decisions were made in their respective file by jotting down all the respective ideas and expanding on each one while voting for the best. The priorities of tasks were set in a similar manor.

‚óè How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

During the start of the sprint, we met everyday, but as the sprint progressed and the group became more aligned in our goals and product we stopped meeting as often.
Going forward, we should spend more time going through the sprint requirements individually and be prepared to take on some tasks or argue some points in the initial meeting.
