Identify the most important user stories.

● You should have around 20. Enough to give us (and you) a good sense of the scope of
the project. If you have less than 20 but feel like the size of your user stories justifies it,
please reach out to a TA to confirm.
● As a guideline: a user story (usually) corresponds to a feature in your project.
● Each user story must obey the format stated in the lecture and it must also contain the
criteria of satisfaction. For this stage, there is no need to estimate user stories.
● Additionally, all stories in PB.md need to be recorded on Jira.
● PB must be ready by May 28 so you can start Sprint 1 planning.
