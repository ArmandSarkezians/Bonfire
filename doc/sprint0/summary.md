## Objective

Bonfire is a Kanban-style, task recording board, made by students, for students and professors. Our goal for Bonfire is to build and run a web application which university students can easily use to manage their assignments and due dates in an organized and convenient fashion, as well as where professors can keep track of aggregate progress of their students for their classes.

## Key Personas

### Student

Fred, a 19 year old student studying software engineering at UTSC in his 3st year, works part-time and studies full time at the same time. Fred is a hard worker and takes 4-5 courses every semester but has a hard time organizing his due dates for all just subjects, especially for his online courses.


### Professor

Professor Pero is a professor of 3 classes and is the Computer Science department head at UTSC. Although his teaching experience has been smooth, every year he struggles with keeping track of the progress of his students assignments for all his classes.

## Key Scenarios

Fred wants to organize his tasks not only for school but for his internship as well, which uses an agile approach. Fred is familiar with Kan-boards from work, which uses Jira. Rather than using two different Kan-board applications, one for work and one for school, he wants to use one single application where he can seamlessly switch between them so he can stay on top of his tasks.

Professor Pero wants to keep track of analytics for all of his classes' students so he knows how far majority of his students are progressing through his assignments. He needs to know if most of his students have started working on the assignment he assigned last week and how many have finished so he knows when to hand out his next assignment.

## Key Principles

User experience (such as dragging and dropping cards, or updating analytics for the professor dashboard) should be smooth at an expense of complexity in the backend of the application.

Students should feel comfortable on all pages and should easily be able to switch between boards and should be able to create a fresh board with ability to select preset templates.

Students should be able to easily take advantage of their boards to help them keep track of their tasks in a simple, elegant and meaningful manner.
