# Release Planning Meeting

For our release goal, we want to complete all of our sprint tasks/epics, minimize all bugs and prepare the project visually.

The core features that need to be fully built out include;
- Creation of course boards and ability to manage students (WRLD-142, WRLD-145, WRLD-195, WRLD-26, WRLD-203)

- Cards and states can be opened, edited, deleted and moved (WRLD-200, WRLD-33, WRLD-32, WRLD-31, WRLD-30)

- Teachers can add assignments with due dates to their classroom for all classroom members to see. (WRLD-142, WRLD-145)
